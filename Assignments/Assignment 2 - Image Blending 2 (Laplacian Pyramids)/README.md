# Computer Vision and Image Processing Assignment 2

## Title: Blending with Laplacian Pyramid

### Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to implement image blending using Laplacian pyramid blending technique, achieving seamless transitions between two images.

### Requirements:
1. **Programming Language:** Python (recommended) or any language with suitable image processing libraries.
2. **Concepts Familiarity:** Understanding of image processing concepts like convolution, Gaussian blur, and Laplacian pyramid.
3. **Basic Skills:** Knowledge of blending and image interpolation techniques.

### Instructions:
1. **Laplacian Pyramid Generation:**
   - Implement a function to generate the Laplacian pyramid of an image.
   
2. **Image Reconstruction:**
   - Implement a function to reconstruct an image from its Laplacian pyramid.
   
3. **Laplacian Pyramid Blending:**
   - Write a function to blend two images using Laplacian pyramid blending.
   
4. **Testing and Experimentation:**
   - Test your implementation with various pairs of images having different sizes and content.
   - Experiment with different parameters to observe their effect on blending results.

### Additional Resources:
1. **Libraries:** OpenCV or Pillow for image processing in Python.
2. **Research:** Papers and tutorials on Laplacian pyramid blending.
3. **Support:** Online forums and communities for assistance with implementation challenges.
